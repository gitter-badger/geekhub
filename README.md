##Contributing
Geekhub is **100% free** and **open-source**. We encourage and support an active, healthy community that accepts contributions from the public – including you!

**Geekhub** is built using **AngualrJS** on the frontend and **Ruby on Rails** on the backend. Frontend and backend are completely seperated to give you a better chance at contributing to the project if you're familiar with just one technology or if you want to contribute to one of them without wanting to deal with the other.

**Before contributing to Geekhub:**

1. Please read the complete mission statements on [geekhub wiki!]. Yes we actually believe this stuff you should too.
2. Dig into **[CONTRIBUTING.MD]**, which covers submitting bugs, requesting new features, preparing your code for a pull request, etc.
3. Not sure what to work on? **We've got some ideas.**

We look forward to seeing your pull requests!
