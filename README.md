###[Contributing to GEEKHUB](https://github.com/adham90/geekhub.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Geekhub is built using AngualrJS on the frontend and Ruby on Rails on the backend. Frontend and backend are completely seperated to give you a better chance at contributing to the project if you're familiar with just one technology or if you want to contribute to one of them without wanting to deal with the other.
