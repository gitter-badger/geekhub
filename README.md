Geekhub is a open-source social network for geeks where geeks can find each other or hubs (meetups) by {skills, location, university, ...}, pair program online to fix code bugs, compete on solving programming problems, etc....

##Built With

* [Ruby on Rails] — Our back end API is a Rails app. It responds to requests RESTfully in JSON.
* [AngularJS] — Our front end is an AngularJS app that communicates with the Rails API.
* [MongoDB] — Our main data store is in MongoDB.
* [Redis] — We use Redis as a cache and for transient data.

Plus lots of Ruby Gems, a complete list of which is at [/backend/Gemfile].


##Contributing
Geekhub is **100% free** and **open-source**. We encourage and support an active, healthy community that accepts contributions from the public – including you!

**Geekhub** is built using **AngualrJS** on the frontend and **Ruby on Rails** on the backend. Frontend and backend are completely seperated to give you a better chance at contributing to the project if you're familiar with just one technology or if you want to contribute to one of them without wanting to deal with the other.

**Before contributing to Geekhub:**

1. Please read the complete mission statements on [geekhub]. Yes we actually believe this stuff you should too.
2. Dig into **[CONTRIBUTING.MD]**, which covers submitting bugs, requesting new features, preparing your code for a pull request, etc.
3. Not sure what to work on? **We've got some ideas.**

We look forward to seeing your pull requests!
