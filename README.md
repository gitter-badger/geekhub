Geekhub is a social network for geeks where geeks can find each other or hubs (meetups) by [skills, location, university, ...], geeks can also compete on solving programming problems.


##Built With

* [Ruby on Rails] — Our back end API is a Rails app. It responds to requests RESTfully in JSON.
* [AngularJS] — Our front end is an AngularJS app that communicates with the Rails API.
* [MongoDB] — Our main data store is in MongoDB.
* [Redis] — We use Redis as a cache and for transient data.

Plus lots of Ruby Gems, a complete list of which is at [/master/Gemfile].


##Contributing
Geekhub is built using AngualrJS on the frontend and Ruby on Rails on the backend. Frontend and backend are completely seperated to give you a better chance at contributing to the project if you're familiar with just one technology or if you want to contribute to one of them without wanting to deal with the other. See the [CONTRIBUTING.md] file for details.

##Contributors
This free, open source software was made possible by a group of volunteers that put many hours of hard work into it. See the [CONTRIBUTORS.md] file for details.
